/*
 * Homography geometric transformation.
 *
 * A two-dimensional projective transformation, or homography, is a
 * line-preserving geometric transformation between two sets of points in the
 * plane. More formally, if P represents the set of points in the plane, a
 * homography is an invertible mapping H from P^2 to itself such that three
 * points p1, p2, p3 are collinear if and only if H(p1), H(p2), H(p3) do.
 *
 * Homographies have important practical applications in the field of computer
 * vision. On the PixInsight platform, this class is an essential component of
 * image registration and astrometry processes.
 *
 * A Homography object can be constructed in three ways:
 *
 * new Homography( Array P1, Array P2 )
 *
 *    Constructor from two 2D point lists. Each element in the P1 and P2 arrays
 *    must have x and y numeric properties. There can be undefined array
 *    elements, but at least 4 defined point pairs are required.
 *
 *    This constructor computes a homography transformation to generate a list
 *    P2 of transformed points from a list P1 of original points. In other
 *    words, the computed homography H works as follows:
 *
 *    P2 = H( P1 )
 *
 *    The transformation matrix is calculated by the Direct Linear
 *    Transformation (DLT) method (see Reference 1). Both point lists must
 *    contain at least four points. If one of the specified point lists
 *    contains less than four points, or if no homography can be estimated from
 *    the specified point lists (which leads to a singular transformation
 *    matrix), this constructor throws an Error exception.
 *
 * new Homography( Matrix H )
 *
 *    Constructs a homography with a prescribed transformation matrix H.
 *
 * new Homography()
 *
 *    Constructs an uninitialized object.
 *

    * last row of the 3x3 transformation matrix is equal to (0, 0, 1). This
    * function verifies that this property holds for the current transformation
    * matrix (if it is valid) up to the machine epsilon for the 64-bit floating
    * point type.
